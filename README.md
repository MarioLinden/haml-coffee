# About

haml-coffee is a haml parser that understand coffeescript. It will render a compiled-haml.js which you
can use in your backbone.js application. It is heavily inspired by Tim Caswells [haml-js](https://github.com/creationix/haml-js).
We developed it since we love haml - and we love coffeescript and we don't want to have a media break in our toolchain.
